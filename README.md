Bank Customer Churning: Artificial Neural Network &amp; XGBClassifier

## Goal:</br>

To create classifier model to predict the potential churning of customers.

## Data set:</br> 

We have been provided 1000 customers records from one of the European bank operating in France , Spain , and Germany. Out of those 1000 records there were 2037 customers have left the bank means churned out. The bank want to detect who were the potential customers who will be churning next so that they could take appropriate action or some policy change for them to stop that churning. 

## Approach:

    1. Data Exploration: EDA </br>
    2. Data preprocessing </br>
    3. Feature Engineering </br>
    4. Training model by ANN & XGBClassifier
    5. Testing
    6. Calculating accuracy score

## Result:</br>

1. The accuracy achieved by ANN: 85.8%  
2. The accuracy achieved by XGBClassifier: 86.9% (best).
